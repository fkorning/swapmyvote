  Hi #{@user.name},
%p
  You're all set to swap your vote with
  = user_profile_link(@swap_with) + "!"
  #{@swap_with.name} is going to vote for the #{@swap_with.willing_party.name} party for you, in the #{@swap_with.constituency.name} constituency.
  In return, you will vote for the #{@swap_with.preferred_party.name} party in your constituency (#{@user.constituency.name}).
%p
  We'll send some reminders to #{@swap_with.name} to remind them to vote for your chosen party on December 12th, and we'll ask them for confirmation once they have.

  - if @swap_with.profile_url.present?
    In the meantime, why not
    %a{href: @swap_with.profile_url} reach out to #{@swap_with.name} directly?
  - if @swap_with_email_consent
    #{@swap_with.name} has also allowed us to share their email address with you
    You can mail them directly: #{@swap_with.email}

%p
  Lastly, why not share Swap My Vote with your social networks so that more people can make their vote count?
