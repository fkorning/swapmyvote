- methods = contact_methods(swap_user)

- if methods.present?

  You can reach out to

  = swap_user.name

  != methods.join " or "

  to get to know your swap partner.

- else

  Unfortunately #{swap_user.name} has not shared their
  email address or social media profile.

- if methods.blank? or (methods.length == 1 && swap_user.facebook_login?)

  If this makes you uncomfortable you can

  -# has to be _url not _path to work from ActionMailer
  = link_to("cancel your swap", faq_url + "#reset", target: "_blank") + "."

- if voting_open?
  = render partial: "shared/go_vote", locals: { user: user }
